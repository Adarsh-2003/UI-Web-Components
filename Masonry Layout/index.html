                    I went inside a tunnel filled with dark <br>
                    Hoping i would see light at the end
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The journey was long i was searching for a spark <br>
                    Searching for a friend who could comprehend
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    In the midst of tunnel, dark all the way <br>
                    Tired of the hope i couldn't hold my pray
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I realised soon i have to mould <br>
                    I knew , it could make me cold
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I decided to blend , blend with the dark <br>
                    The tunnel was about to end and so was my arc
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The light stinged , it stinged my eyes <br>
                    Its wasn't about me its 'bout journey i emphasize
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Now it doesn't matter if i'm at the terminal <br>
                    Coz now i'm the part of tunnel

                <p>
                    You could find joy in smallest thing <br>

                </p>
    
                <p>
                    One day you'll leave this world behind <br>
                    There's meaning in life you need to find.

                <p>
                    I went inside a tunnel filled with dark <br>
                    Hoping i would see light at the end
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The journey was long i was searching for a spark <br>
                    Searching for a friend who could comprehend
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    In the midst of tunnel, dark all the way <br>
                    Tired of the hope i couldn't hold my pray
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I realised soon i have to mould <br>
                    I knew , it could make me cold
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I decided to blend , blend with the dark <br>
                    The tunnel was about to end and so was my arc
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The light stinged , it stinged my eyes <br>
                    Its wasn't about me its 'bout journey i emphasize
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Now it doesn't matter if i'm at the terminal <br>
                    Coz now i'm the part of tunnel
                </p>
